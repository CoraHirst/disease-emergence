   abstract = {It is unclear when, where and how novel pathogens such as
human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV), monkeypox and severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) will cross the barriers that separate their natural reservoirs from human populations and ignite the epidemic spread of novel infectious diseases. New pathogens are believed to emerge from animal reservoirs when ecological changes increase the pathogen’s opportunities to enter the human population1 and to generate subsequent human-to- human transmission2. Effective human-to-human transmission requires that the pathogen’s basic reproductive number, R0, should exceed one, where R0 is the average number of secondary infections arising from one infected individual in a completely susceptible population3. However, an increase in R0, even when insufﬁcient to generate an epidemic, nonetheless increases the number ofsubsequently infected individuals. Here we show that, as a consequence of this, the probability of pathogen evolution to R0 > 1 and subsequent disease emergence can increase markedly.},
